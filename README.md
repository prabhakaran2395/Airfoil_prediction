Motivation for this project is to help the engineers predict the 'Drag coefficient' and 'Lift coefficient' of their digit airfoils without running a physical test or a CFD simulation

**Input variables:**
* Angle of attack
* Maximum thickness of the airfoil
* Chord at maximum thickness
* Maximum camber of the airfoil
* Chord at maximum thickness
* Reynolds number

**Target variables**
* Lift coefficient
* Drag coefficient
